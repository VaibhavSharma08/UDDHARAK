# UDDHARAK_Hack_SURREY
REPO for project made during Cuse Hacks

This is the GitHub repository for the project UDDHARAK: Temperature and Humidity Monitoring System.

You can find the .ino files containing the code written for the Arduino Nano connected to the DHT 11 temperature and humidity sensors. The code measures the temperature and humidity continuously when the sensor is put inside the container filled with grains.

There are also the presentation and images which describe the project.
